# My Personal Identity HNGx App

 A mobile application that prominently features my Slack identity, incorporates my Slack profile picture, and includes an “Open GitHub” button. When pressed, this button should utilize a WebView component to redirect users to my GitHub profile within the application itself.

## Key Features

1. **Slack Name**: The application’s main screen prominently displays my Slack name.

2. **Display Picture**: Integrates my Slack display picture onto the main screen, ensuring it’s clear and of high quality.

3. **Open GitHub Button**: Adds a button labeled “Open GitHub” to the main screen. When pressed, it correctly redirects users to my GitHub profile using a WebView component within the application.
